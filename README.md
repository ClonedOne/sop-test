# sop-test

This repository contains some basic code written in order to provide a working example of the Same Origin Policy. The code was developed using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as web server.

####Same Origin Example

The first example included in the repository shows the correct behavior of the Same Origin Policy applied to a very simple test website. In this situation the server will provide a domain `local.com` with its subdomains `store.local.com` and `blog.local.com`.
